# Numerical Examples

## A. Classical canonical ensembles via MD

### 1. Simulation detail

#### 1.1 two 1-dimensional models

* harmonic potential $V(x) = m \omega^2 x^2 / 2$

  parameters: $m = 1$, $\omega = 1$, $\beta = 8$

* quartic potential $V(x) = x^4 / 4$

  parameters: $m = 1$, $\beta = 8$

#### 1.2 three typical real systems

* H~2~O molecule with the potential energy surface developed by Partridge and Schwenke

  parameters: $T = 100K$, $\Delta t$, 

  After equilibrating the system, 20 trajectories with each propagated up to 1.2 ns are used for estimating the energies.

* Ne~13~, a Lennard-Jones (LJ) cluster

  parameter: $T = 14K$
